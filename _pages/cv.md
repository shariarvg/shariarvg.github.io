B.S. in Mathematics and Statistical Science, Duke University, 2024 (expected)

Coursework: High Dimensional Data Analysis (Fall 2022), Regression Analysis (F' 2022), Mathematics of Regression (F' 2022), Elementary Differential Equations (F' 2022), Modern Statistical Modeling, Machine Learning for Legislative Behavior, Advanced Probability, Advanced Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Algorithms and Data Structures

Work experience
======
* Summer 2022: Data Scientist, Snowflake
  * Built SNOWprofiler, an anomaly detection and insight generation package 
    that identifies data quality issues in Snowflake tables
  * Built front-end user interface for SNOWprofiler using Streamlit
  * Created an original Synthetic Test Data Generator
  
* Summer 2022: Research Assistant, Johns Hopkins University
  * Worked under the direction of Dr. Aki Nishimura and Andrew Chin
  * Studied literature in Bayesian prior selection (Horseshoe, Bayesian Bridge, Spike-and-Slab, etc.)
  * Derived more efficient prior density functions using numerical linear algebra identities
  * Contributed to the bayesbridge software package by writing numerical integration classes 
    and an inverse CDF sampler
 
* Summer 2021: Research Assistant, UCLA
  * Mentored by Dr. Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld
  * Leveraged statistical learning models to build KERMIT – a Python package that provides quantitative insights on text
    data to social scientists – under the mentorship of Professor Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld.
  * Built a binary classifier that labelled the topics of 450,000 Arabic Tweets by fine-tuning Google’s BERT model
  * Extrapolated insights about Syrian citizens during Aleppo war by analyzing the topics of tweets over time

* Summer 2020: Research Assistant, Wharton School of Business
  * Senior Research Project; Mentored by Dr. Jonah Berger
  * Trained a latent Dirichlet allocation model on a corpus of research articles and movie scripts to identify themes
  * Used the Ireland-Pennebaker formula to create a similarity metric that comapred a document's topic distribution to that of its genre/journal
  * Built a multivariate regression to identify a causal effect of atypicality (the opposite of similarity) on text success
   

Skills
======
* Programming: Python, R, Java
* Writing Without Google Docs: HTML, CSS, Streamlit, LaTeX
