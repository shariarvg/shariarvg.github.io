Hi, I'm Sharz, a math student, undergraduate researcher, and amateur writer! I made this page to serve as an unoriginally-designed nexus of my research and personal projects.

I'm interested in high-dimensional statistical inference, including Bayesian methods for searching multicollinear parameter spaces. In the past, I've worked on adapting foundational NLP models to social science questions. As for my writing, I've written short stories, satirical media, and a few screenplays, all involving a mixture of comedy and either magical realism or science fiction. 

Background
======
I'm currently in my second year of undergraduate study at Duke, where I'm majoring in mathematics and statistical science. I expect to graduate in August 2024, May 2024, December 2024, or May 2025 (in decreasing order of probability). While at Duke, I've had the privilege of taking classes from great professors both in my majors and outside them. Eventually I'll get around to posting some notes from those classes here, in the off-chance that any prospective student stumbles on this site.

I've been a research assistant in statistical learning for three groups. Most recently, I contributed to the bayesbridge package while working under the mentorship of Dr. Aki Nishmura and Andrew Chin at Hopkins. Before then, I built supervised text classifiers for studying political tweets from Syrian citizens under the direction of Dr. Zachary Steinert-Threlkeld (UCLA), and I adapted latent Dirichlet allocation to the analysis of movie scripts and academic research articles in collaboration with Dr. Jonah Berger (UPenn Wharton).

This past summer, I had the chance to build an end-to-end anomaly detection and automated insight generation package as a data scientist intern at Snowflake, Inc. If you're at Snowflake and would like to use that internal product, feel free to shoot me a message for setup help.
