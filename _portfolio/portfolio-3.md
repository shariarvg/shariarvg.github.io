Using Google's BERT model, I trained a binary topic classifier on 2,000 labelled tweets from Syrian civilians. I then ran this model on 450,000 tweets and identified the presence of themes like anti-regime sentiment, Russian involvement, and even religion. Next, I trained models to identify the presence of emotions like fear, anger, and hope in the same tweets. I analyzed the evolution of emotion and topicality over the course of the war and made assertions about how war events shaped national perception.
