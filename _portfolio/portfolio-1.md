LendingClub (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform where people get loans for cars, home improvement projects, and everything in between. We sought to understand whether borrowers on LC are getting charged higher or lower interest rates than similar borrowers (quantified by clustering on FICO, income, amount requested, and other factors) on external sites. We found that to be the case. We also provided analyses of how the relationship between interest rates and loan repayment rates changes over time.
